## Instructions for You:

1. **Look through your HEIC files** and identify which ones show flooring work
2. **Tell me what each image shows** (e.g., "IMG_0210 shows oak hardwood in a living room")
3. **I'll help rename and move them** to the appropriate folders
4. **Convert HEIC to JPG** for web compatibility

## Priority Images to Identify:

From your list, these are likely flooring-related:
- IMG_0210.HEIC
- IMG_0211.HEIC  
- IMG_0212.HEIC
- IMG_3955.HEIC (marked as "latest-hardwood-flooring")
- Any others that show floor installations

## Next Steps:

Please tell me:
1. Which of your IMG files show flooring work?
2. What type of flooring is in each image?
3. What room/setting is shown?
4. Any special features (before/after, process shots, etc.)?

Then I can help you rename and organize them properly!
