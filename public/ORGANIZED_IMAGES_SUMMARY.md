## Remaining Unlabeled Images
The following images are still in the main public folder and need to be labeled and organized:

### HEIC Images (Need conversion to JPG and labeling)
- IMG_0017.HEIC through IMG_4322.HEIC (multiple images)
- IMG_0123.MOV, IMG_1512.MOV, IMG_1534.MOV (video files)

### Already Labeled JPG Images (Need categorization)
- `IMG_8812.JPG` - Needs description and proper folder placement

## Next Steps
1. Convert HEIC images to JPG format for web compatibility
2. Label the converted images with descriptive names
3. Move labeled images to appropriate portfolio folders
4. Update website portfolio sections to display organized images
5. Create image galleries for each category
